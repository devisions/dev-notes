# My Notes on <a href="http://isis.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Isisâ„¢</a>

Apache Isis is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in Java.

Write your business logic in entities, domain services or view models, and the framework dynamically generates a representation of that domain model as a webapp or a rich hypermedia REST API.
